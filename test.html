            Introduction to the use of digital computers for problem solving and
            communicating solutions. Covers use of procedures, decisions, loops
            and arrays focusing on scientific and engineering problem analysis,
            algorithm design, and program structure. Also includes organizing,
            tabulating, and graphing program output with different software
            tools to communicate results. This course is currently taught
            primarily in Python. <strong>NOTE</strong>: This course is not
            intended for BCS or BScSwE students.
